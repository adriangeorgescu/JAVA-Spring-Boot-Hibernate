# JAVA-Spring-Boot-Hibernate

Exploring Spring boot - Hibernate

Solely purpose is to catch a glimpse on JPA and scratch the surface of the most popular ORM implementation: Hibernate.

Modified project from repo "JAVA-Spring-Boot-JDBC" to use the Hibernate ORM (using: Repositories, Entities, etc.)

Cheers!
